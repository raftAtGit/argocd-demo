  # Sync policy
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true # Specifies if resources should be pruned during auto-syncing ( false by default ).
      selfHeal: true # Specifies if partial app sync should be executed when resources are changed only in target Kubernetes cluster and no git change detected ( false by default ).
      allowEmpty: false # Allows deleting all application resources during automatic syncing ( false by default ).
    syncOptions:     # Sync options which modifies sync behavior
    # - Validate=false # disables resource validation (equivalent to 'kubectl apply --validate=false') ( true by default ).
    - CreateNamespace=true # Namespace Auto-Creation ensures that namespace specified as the application destination exists in the destination cluster.
    # - PrunePropagationPolicy=foreground # Supported policies are background, foreground and orphan.
    # - PruneLast=true # Allow the ability for resource pruning to happen as a final, implicit wave of a sync operation
    # - RespectIgnoreDifferences=true # When syncing changes, respect fields ignored by the ignoreDifferences configuration
    # - ApplyOutOfSyncOnly=true # Only sync out-of-sync resources, rather than applying every object in the application

    # # The retry feature is available since v1.7
    # retry:
    #   limit: 5 # number of failed sync attempt retries; unlimited number of attempts if less than 0
    #   backoff:
    #     duration: 5s # the amount to back off. Default unit is seconds, but could also be a duration (e.g. "2m", "1h")
    #     factor: 2 # a factor to multiply the base duration after each failed retry
    #     maxDuration: 3m # the maximum amount of time allowed for the backoff strategy
